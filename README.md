# Monopoly

This Matlab package contains the necessary objects, functions, and scripts for training autonomous agents to play the board game Monopoly via reinforcement learning. This includes functionality for running Monte Carlo simulations of Monopoly games using either a random policy or an epsilon-greedy policy on a specified value function. The trained models may then be used with the provided `interface.mlx` script for implementation in player v. computer matches.
